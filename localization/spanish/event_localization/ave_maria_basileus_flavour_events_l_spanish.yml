The senators then assembled to give their thanks to me and to pray for the health of my son. They pray for him to live a long and fruitful life and to see him produce his own children born in the purple, for this would ensure the stability and continuation of the Empire. \n\nAs is customary, the demes now demand that I host races in his honour. Fifty men from the regiments, fifty demesmen from each side and fifty of the cities administrators shall be selected to assemble tomorrow morning to shout my son's name and recite the acclamations."
